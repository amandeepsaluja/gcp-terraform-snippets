# GCP Terraform Snippets

This repo contains useful Terraform snippets for managing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Hope you find it useful!

I'm using Workload Identity Federation (WIF) to authenticate to GCP. You can find more information about WIF [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation). And to deploy my resources, I'm using Terraform in GitHub Actions.
